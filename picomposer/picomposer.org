    - In progress
    - Up next
    - Done
      - sprites
      - inserting rests with 'r'
    - Dependencies
*** Delete previous note with backspace :feature:
*** Adding notes after deleting notes has weird effect :bug:
*** Add sharps/flats :feature:
*** Octaves for a full range of notes :feature:
*** Fix strings entered via keyboard :bug:fixed:
    strings are reporting with the wrong number of characters,
    they don't concatenate properly:
    
    ex: entered s='test' -- via keyboard
    s..'blah' -- produces gibberish
    #s -- gives 5
    
    Fix: I assumed pressing enter entered a newline character \n. It
    does not. It enters a carriage return \r which is why the text
    kept over-printing.
    
*** Main menu allowing you to load an album or create a new one :feature:
*** Create album data structure and functions :feature:
    Need to be a bit more organized so things will need some rewrites
    once it's in place. But a better structure will make for better
    software.
*** Create menu function for creating menu states :feature:
*** Rework note entry for new album data structure :update:
*** Update octave changes :update:
*** Save/load songs (for editing) :feature:
    - [X] pretty-print s-exp from save_to_file function
    - [X] Define file format: canonical s-expressions
      - The file is simply a list with one element for each song
        in the album
      - Each song is a list, the first element is the song title
        followed by up to four voices
      - Each voice is a list, the first element is the
        instrument number 0-15, the rest of the voice data is
        notes
      - Each note is a list but there are several kinds:
	- A simple note has the tag 'simple', a time and 2 bytes
          of binary note data as defined by PICO-8 for the SFX
          section
	- Note effects come in several types and are intended to
          be extensible. They contain an effect tag as the first
          element followed by whatever data is required to
          generate the note or notes needed to produce the
          effect.

** Cancelled (unlimited)
*** Use streams to play the songs :feature:
    This doesn't really make sense since you have to manage the time
    anyway so abstacting it away with a normal function is easier than
    abstracting it away with a stream.
** Ideas, features, bugs, etc (unlimited)
*** Clefs. As is the staff is in treble clef. Adding, at least, bass clef would be useful :feature:

*** Effects/articulations (tremolo, etc.) :feature:

*** Ties and slurs :feature:
*** key signatures :feature:
*** Setting/changing tempo :feature:
*** Draw leger lines :feature:
